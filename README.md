# crystal
crystal provides unified metadata management platform for cloud and more.

# Strategy and origin
As a part of [SODA Strato](https://github.com/sodafoundation/strato) project, there are modules for S3 metadata management developed. 
However, metadata management can be a horizontal component across other projects or modules of SODA ODF(Open Data Framework). The same 
can be deployed for other data management platforms as well. Hence, when crystal project is considered, we thought of bringing the 
metadata management modules for s3 from SODA Strato project to this crystal project. 

Based on our analysis (in progress), there are different open source project focussing on metadata management. So the key strategy is to 
further investigate, derive or onboard suitable modules or projects to crystal solution. 

So, develop the delta components in this project and integrate other open solutions to build the complete crystal platform of 
unified metadata management
